## Data

Many university courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. 

The article titled, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165?casa_token=3Zz3cupeQ8MAAAAA:8CMoSg5s3BgdhwM6oW9tjcWSZ-MkgYTGYitN4NxvRBAfHuKcmoPnTtzxAgOSURYpDYD8C5EDJg"> Beauty in the classroom: instructors' pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity</a> by Hamermesh and Parker found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings. 

In this lab we will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes into a positive lecturer evaluation.

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of lecturers from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students rated the lecturers' physical appearance. The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course/lecturer and columns represent variables about the courses and lecturers. 

The data to be analyzed are saved in a csv file called `evals.csv`(you can read more about it <a href="https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=evals"> here</a>). We can load the data and view the first few lines of the data by running the code below.


```{r import-data-optional, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
evals <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glasgow-Stats-L1-L2/S1Z_Lab4/main/evals.csv"))
glimpse(evals)
```

You may download the dataset named `evals.csv` file from our Moodle course page. Once the file has downloaded, **save it in the same folder** as the `R` script file you created and saved for this lab. You should now set your working directory to this location by clicking `Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location`. You can load the data set into your workspace by running `evals <- read.csv("evals.csv")`. 


It can be seen that the data contains 23 variables which we will explore to see if they have any relationship with the variable `score`, the evaluation score of each lecturer in each course (the "response" variable). These variables include both categorical and numerical types of variables.

To find out more about each variable we can use the `help` function by running `?evals`.

### Exploring the data

Before we start to model the data, we need to understand the data and the different types of variables.

<br>

**What type of study design is this?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_name1 <- sample(c(
   "Experimental",
   answer = "Observational"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_name1)`

<br>

### **Exercise 1**

Plot the `score` variable using a histogram to investigate its distribution.  You can specify the colour of your plot by using the `fill = ...` argument (see  <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names.html"> here</a> for some colours with their names in **R**).

`r hide("Hint")`

```{r hint1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ???, aes(???)) +
  geom_histogram(???)
```

`r unhide()`


`r hide("Solution")`

```{r sol1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "violetred", bins = 40)
```

`r unhide()`

<br>

**Is the distribution skewed?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_name <- sample(c(
   "No",
   answer = "Yes, left-skewed",
   "Yes, right-skewed"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_name)`

<br>


### **Exercise 2**

Create a boxplot of `score` against `rank` to explore any relationship between the professor evaluation  score and rank of professor based on academic appointment categories applied in the U.S. and Canada. The `rank` variable can take three values, `teaching`, `tenure track` and `tenure`, where teaching professors are generally the most junior, and tenured professors are the most senior.

`r hide("Hint")`

```{r hint2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ???, aes(???)) +
  geom_boxplot(???) +
    coord_flip()
```

`r unhide()`


`r hide("Solution")`

```{r sol2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = score, y = rank)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue2") + 
    coord_flip()
```

`r unhide()`

<br>

**What are the values that are used when creating a boxplot? (There are multiple correct answers)**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_bxplt <- sample(c(
         "Mean",
         "Variance",
         answer = "Minimum",
         answer = "Maximum",
         answer = "1st Quartile",
         answer = "3rd Quartile",
         "Mode",
         answer = "Median",
         "Standard Deviation"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_bxplt)`

<br>

**Which of the ranks corrensponds to the highest average score?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_rank <- sample(c(
         answer = "Teaching",
         "Tenured",
         "Tenure-track"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_rank)`

<br>

**Which of the boxplots has the largest spread (based on the IQR)?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_spread <- sample(c(
         "Teaching",
         "Tenured",
         answer = "Tenure-track"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_spread)`

<br>

Create a boxplot of `score` against `ethnicity` to explore any relationship, also using colours to distinguish between the different values of `gender`.

`r hide("Hint")`

```{r hintn, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = ???, aes(???)) +
  geom_boxplot(???)
```

`r unhide()`


`r hide("Solution")`

```{r soln, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = evals, aes(x = ethnicity, y = score )) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = gender))
```

`r unhide()`

<br>

**Does it appear that different ethnic groups have a similar average score for both men and women?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_eth <- sample(c(
   "Yes",
   answer = "No"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_eth)`

<br>

**Does it appear there is a effect for `gender` within the ethnicity variable?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_gen <- sample(c(
   "No",
   answer = "Yes"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_gen)`

<br>

**Which boxplot would you think has the greatest variablility?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
q_bxvr <- sample(c(
         answer = "Not Minority Ethnicity Female",
         "Not Minority Ethnicity Male",
         "Minority Ethnicity Male",
         "Minority Ethnicity Female"
)
)
```

`r longmcq(q_bxvr)`

<br>
